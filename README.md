======ATTENTION:

At the time of writing, these code samples were written for the Android Eclipse ADT Bundle.  I have included additional code samples to work with Android Studio, so you will find both Android Eclipse code samples and Android Studio code samples.  Support for the Android Studio code samples will be extremely limited due to these code samples not being covered in content of the book.  However, I wanted to provide these as a reference so that readers would be able to see how these same exact code samples work in Android Studio.

======Welcome

Welcome to the code samples that accompany the Addison Wesley Professional book titled "Introduction to Android Application Development: Android Essentials, Fourth Edition", written by Joseph Annuzzi, Jr., Lauren Darcey, and Shane Conder.

These code samples will help you understand the contents of the book by allowing you to interact with application projects that implement many of the Android SDK features discussed throughout.

You can download the files as a ZIP package using the ZIP download button seen towards the top of this page.

You could download all the files as a ZIP: https://github.com/lambo4jos/introToAndroid4e/archive/master.zip

Or you could issue the following command from a command line to get the code.
